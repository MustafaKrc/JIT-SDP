# JIT-SDP Research Repository


This repository contains code and notebooks related to research on Just-In-Time Software Defect Prediction (JIT-SDP), focusing on analyzing various Java projects.

## Repository Structure

*   `/src`: Contains the primary Python scripts used for data processing (e.g., using CK metrics) and analysis pipelines.
*   `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature selection, model training (e.g., LSTM, Transformers), and results analysis.
*   `/dataset/java`: Placeholder structure for datasets derived from analyzed Java projects.
*   `/third_party`: Includes external tools used in the research, such as the CK metrics tool.
*   `/repositories`: Intended location for cloned Java project repositories (likely excluded via `.gitignore`).

## Note

This repository is primarily for the research code and notebooks. Large datasets, intermediate files, generated logs, and cloned external repositories are typically excluded from version control.

This repository is intended solely for research purposes.
